.SYNOPSIS
    Retrieves DHCP lease reservations from all DHCP servers in Active Directory and exports unique entries (based on IPAddress) to a CSV file.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script performs the following steps:
    1. Retrieves a list of DHCP servers from Active Directory using Get-DhcpServerInDC.
    2. Iterates through each server to obtain its DHCP scopes using Get-DHCPServerv4Scope.
    3. For each scope, retrieves lease reservation information using Get-DHCPServerv4Lease.
    4. Aggregates all lease reservations into an array.
    5. Uses a hashtable to filter out duplicates based on the IPAddress property.
    6. Exports the unique lease reservations to a CSV file named 'DHCPReservations.csv'.

.NOTES
    Ensure you run this script with appropriate permissions and that the DHCP server cmdlets are available.
